                <p>My name is Althea Louise L. Sabas, and I am thrilled to share my journey as I delve into the dynamic and rewarding world of education. This e-portfolio is a reflection of my learning experiences, personal insights, and meaningful encounters as I bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and its practical applications in real-world settings. </p><br>
                <p>I am deeply passionate about nurturing the potential of young learners, fostering curiosity, and creating a supportive environment where they can thrive. I firmly believe that teaching is not just a profession but a calling—one that demands patience, dedication, and a genuine love for learning.</p><br>
                <p>Throughout this field study, I have had the privilege of observing and engaging with experienced educators and bright young minds at the Integrated Laboratory School of Cebu Normal University and Cebu City Central School. These experiences have been instrumental in sharpening my skills, broadening my perspectives, and solidifying my commitment to becoming an impactful teacher.</p><br>
                <p>Beyond the walls of the classroom, this journey has taught me the value of building relationships with learners, and the larger school community. I have gained a deeper appreciation for the collaborative nature of education and how it takes a village to empower young learners. Through meaningful interactions, I have seen the importance of empathy, adaptability, and the constant pursuit of growth in the teaching profession.</p><br>
               <p>This e-portfolio also highlights how I’ve embraced challenges and turned them into opportunities for improvement. Whether it’s refining my observation skills, understanding diverse learning styles, or navigating unexpected situations, I view every experience as a stepping stone towards becoming a more effective and compassionate educator.</p><br>

            <div class="FS-Content">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field Study 1 is the first in a series of six sequential studies in the Bachelor of Elementary Education and the Bachelor of Secondary Education Programs (BEED and BSED) offered by the Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs). Field study 1 is linked with a professional education subject. It is the prerogative of the TEI to match with an appropriate subject such as Child and Adolescent Development, Principles of Teaching, or Facilitating Learning. The focus of Field Study 1 is observation of the learners, school structure and the community. Since this is the first time the student teachers have been exposed to the school environment, they are expected to take note of the school and classroom facilities, and the organizational set-up of the school. The PSTs shall observe the behavior of the learners in the actual learning environment. Based on their observations of learners, PSTs shall develop their understanding on feasible approaches to facilitate learning considering the various phases of growth and development. To assist their transition, the students will be paired with a “buddy”. Included in FS 1 is the enhancement of the students’ communication skills with his/her buddy since they are expected to be adequate in the language they will be using during their hands-on teaching in the remaining field studies</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Classroom Observations</h2>

            <button class="accordion">The Learners</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
              <p>During my observations at both <b>Integrated Laboratory School</b> and <b>City Central Elementary School</b>, I noticed distinct differences in the learners’ behaviors and attitudes, which highlighted the diversity in learning environments and student characteristics.</p><br>
              <p>At the <b>Integrated Laboratory School</b>, the learners were very intelligent, attentive, and actively engaged in their lessons. They demonstrated a high level of focus and were eager to participate, showcasing their ability to absorb information quickly. These students communicated effectively with their teachers, asking insightful questions and contributing meaningfully to discussions. Their ability to articulate their thoughts reflected a well-developed set of communication skills, and their interaction with their teachers was both respectful and productive. This dynamic facilitated a classroom atmosphere where students felt comfortable and motivated to learn. The learners displayed a good balance between being lively and focused. Although some were energetic, they were still able to channel that energy towards learning, indicating that the classroom environment supported a healthy blend of enthusiasm and attentiveness.</p><br>
              <p>In addition to their academic engagement, the students at Integrated Laboratory School also exhibited strong collaboration skills. They worked well together during group activities, showing mutual respect and openness to one another’s ideas. This cooperative spirit not only enhanced their learning experience but also promoted a sense of community within the classroom. They also displayed a high level of responsibility, taking ownership of their actions and staying focused on tasks. Even when distracted, they would quickly return to their tasks when reminded, demonstrating self-discipline and the ability to manage their behavior effectively.</p><br>
              <p>On the other hand, the learners at <b>City Central Elementary School</b> presented a different set of characteristics. While also full of energy, these students were more playful and often exhibited behaviors that sometimes made it challenging for them to focus on their lessons. They were often described as kiatan (mischievous), and while their enthusiasm was noticeable, it occasionally interfered with their ability to listen attentively to their teacher. However, despite their playful nature, these students showed a sense of responsibility when it came to classroom chores, such as cleaning their environment. They took pride in maintaining the cleanliness of their classroom, which reflected their awareness of shared responsibility and teamwork.</p><br>
              <p>The sense of teamwork among the learners at City Central Elementary School was one of the most notable aspects of my observation. While they might not have always been completely focused during lessons, their ability to cooperate with one another during group tasks or cleaning duties was impressive. They supported each other, demonstrating a strong sense of community within the classroom. Their teamwork and sense of responsibility were essential to the smooth functioning of their classroom, showing that they understood the importance of contributing to the collective success of their peers.</p><br>
              <p>However, the learners at City Central Elementary School did face challenges in terms of maintaining focus during lessons. Their energy and playfulness often distracted them, making it more difficult for them to stay engaged with the lesson. This pointed to the need for more engaging and interactive teaching strategies to help harness their energy more effectively. Incorporating hands-on activities, movement-based learning, or other engaging methods could help redirect their energy into productive academic pursuits. Additionally, strengthening the connection between the teacher and students through interactive discussions and activities might encourage better listening and focus.</p><br>
              <p>In conclusion, the learners at both Integrated Laboratory School and City Central Elementary School displayed unique qualities that made each classroom dynamic in its own way. The learners at Integrated Laboratory School were more focused, disciplined, and communicative, while those at City Central Elementary School showed an abundance of energy, responsibility, and teamwork. Both groups demonstrated potential for growth and success, but each required different approaches from their teachers to effectively guide them in their learning journey. The Integrated Laboratory School students thrived in an environment that encouraged collaboration and self-discipline, while the City Central Elementary School learners needed strategies to better channel their energy and maintain focus. Ultimately, both groups of learners have great potential, and with the right guidance, they can achieve their academic and personal goals.</p><br>

            <button class="accordion">The Teacher</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
                <p>At the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS), teaching is an exciting and dynamic experience, thanks to the creativity and innovation of the teachers. Instead of just relying on traditional methods, they bring lessons to life by using a wide range of teaching strategies. Whether it’s through group projects, interactive discussions, or hands-on activities, the lessons are designed to capture students' attention and keep them engaged. This creative approach ensures that students not only learn the material but also enjoy the process, making learning feel like an adventure rather than a task.</p><br>
                <p>A key aspect of teaching at ILS is the use of technology. Teachers incorporate digital tools like interactive whiteboards, apps, and online resources to make lessons more engaging and accessible. By using technology, they can present information in visually stimulating ways and offer students a chance to explore the material in different formats. It also helps students develop important digital skills, which are becoming increasingly essential in today’s world. The combination of creativity and technology gives students a richer, more interactive learning experience that goes beyond the basics.</p><br>
                <p>Along with creativity and technology, the teachers at ILS are also skilled at maintaining a positive yet authoritative presence in the classroom. They set clear expectations and create a respectful environment where students feel comfortable but know when to focus. This balance between authority and encouragement helps ensure that the classroom runs smoothly, with students actively participating and paying attention. Teachers guide the class in a way that fosters mutual respect, making sure that students feel valued while also staying on track with their learning.</p><br>
                <p>At City Central Elementary School, the teaching style tends to be more traditional. Teachers usually stand in front of the class and provide direct instruction, explaining concepts to the students. While this method ensures that important information is delivered clearly, it can sometimes feel less engaging, especially for students who thrive in more interactive environments. Still, teachers at City Central do make an effort to encourage participation by asking questions and creating space for students to share their ideas. This approach works well for some students but might not capture the interest of others who benefit from more creative, hands-on learning experiences.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, both schools have their strengths. ILS stands out for its creativity, use of technology, and strong classroom management, creating an environment where students are motivated and eager to learn. At City Central Elementary, the traditional teaching methods work for ensuring students receive important information, but there’s room for more variety in how lessons are delivered. Both approaches contribute to students’ growth in different ways, and finding a balance between creativity, technology, and effective classroom management is key to creating a learning environment where all students can thrive.</p><br>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FS1 course has been an eye-opening and transformative experience for me. It provided me with the opportunity to bridge the gap between theory and practice, allowing me to observe and analyze the dynamics of real-life educational settings. Through this journey, I have gained valuable insights into the teaching-learning process, classroom management, and the role of educators in shaping students’ growth.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most impactful aspects of this course was the chance to engage in hands-on activities and immerse myself in authentic classroom environments. Observing seasoned educators in action not only deepened my understanding of effective teaching strategies but also inspired me to reflect on my own future role as an educator.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this course, I learned the importance of being adaptable, resourceful, and reflective. Every observation and task challenged me to think critically and evaluate how different strategies could be applied to address diverse learning needs. These experiences helped me grow not only as a learner but also as a future professional in the field.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the reflections and discussions allowed me to process my experiences and draw meaningful lessons from them. I realized the value of continuous learning, open-mindedness, and collaboration in achieving success in the educational field.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This FS1 course has strengthened my passion for education and my determination to make a positive impact on learners. It has prepared me to take the next steps in my journey with confidence, enthusiasm, and a deeper sense of purpose.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for this enriching experience and excited to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained as I continue my path toward becoming a skilled and compassionate educator.</p>
