                <p>My name is <b>Althea Louise L. Sabas</b>, and I am excited to share my journey as I explore and grow in this field. This e-portfolio captures my learning experiences, insights, and reflections as I connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications.</p><br>
                <p>I am passionate about teaching young learners, and I believe that hands-on learning is essential for personal and professional growth. Through this field study, I have had the privilege of engaging in meaningful observation at the Integrated Laboratory School of Cebu Normal University and Cebu City Central School, which has enhanced my understanding and skills.</p><br>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my e-portfolio. I hope it provides you with a clear view of my journey, my aspirations, and my commitment to making a difference as a teacher.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">About FS 1</h2>
            <div class="FS-Content">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field Study 1 is the first in a series of six sequential studies in the Bachelor of Elementary Education and the Bachelor of Secondary Education Programs (BEED and BSED) offered by the Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs). Field study 1 is linked with a professional education subject. It is the prerogative of the TEI to match with an appropriate subject such as Child and Adolescent Development, Principles of Teaching, or Facilitating Learning. The focus of Field Study 1 is observation of the learners, school structure and the community. Since this is the first time the student teachers have been exposed to the school environment, they are expected to take note of the school and classroom facilities, and the organizational set-up of the school. The PSTs shall observe the behavior of the learners in the actual learning environment. Based on their observations of learners, PSTs shall develop their understanding on feasible approaches to facilitate learning considering the various phases of growth and development. To assist their transition, the students will be paired with a “buddy”. Included in FS 1 is the enhancement of the students’ communication skills with his/her buddy since they are expected to be adequate in the language they will be using during their hands-on teaching in the remaining field studies</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FS1 course has been an eye-opening and transformative experience for me. It provided me with the opportunity to bridge the gap between theory and practice, allowing me to observe and analyze the dynamics of real-life educational settings. Through this journey, I have gained valuable insights into the teaching-learning process, classroom management, and the role of educators in shaping students’ growth.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most impactful aspects of this course was the chance to engage in hands-on activities and immerse myself in authentic classroom environments. Observing seasoned educators in action not only deepened my understanding of effective teaching strategies but also inspired me to reflect on my own future role as an educator.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this course, I learned the importance of being adaptable, resourceful, and reflective. Every observation and task challenged me to think critically and evaluate how different strategies could be applied to address diverse learning needs. These experiences helped me grow not only as a learner but also as a future professional in the field.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the reflections and discussions allowed me to process my experiences and draw meaningful lessons from them. I realized the value of continuous learning, open-mindedness, and collaboration in achieving success in the educational field.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This FS1 course has strengthened my passion for education and my determination to make a positive impact on learners. It has prepared me to take the next steps in my journey with confidence, enthusiasm, and a deeper sense of purpose.</p><br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for this enriching experience and excited to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained as I continue my path toward becoming a skilled and compassionate educator.</p>
